# Project Summary
This is a simple application that runs a local AI Chatbot similar to ChatGPT. It is completely free and runs entirely on your machine.

# Stack
* Backend: FastAPI framework using the Python language
* Frontend: Nuxt/VueJS framework
* AI: Meta's Llama 3 large language model
* DevOps: Docker for application containerization

# Runing the application
Since the application is dockerized, simply run the `start.sh` script to build and start the containers. The application is accessible on port [localhost](http://localhost). API keys are not needed since this AI model runs locally. The only prerequisite is that Docker is installed on your computer.
